## Security Response Process

### Timeline

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability within 48-72 hours
- **Update**: We will provide regular updates on our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 7 days
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate responsible disclosure with you

### Severity Classification

| Severity | Description | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, private key exposure | 24-48 hours |
| **High** | Privilege escalation, cryptographic weaknesses | 48-72 hours |
| **Medium** | Information disclosure, DoS attacks | 1 week |
| **Low** | Minor security improvements | 2 weeks |

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Verify Downloads** - Always download from official sources
2. **Check Signatures** - Verify GPG signatures when available
3. **Secure Environment** - Use on secure, offline systems for production
4. **Test First** - Always test with small amounts before using real funds
5. **Backup Safety** - Store mnemonic phrases securely and separately

### For Developers

1. **Code Review** - All cryptographic code must be reviewed
2. **Static Analysis** - Use tools like cppcheck and clang-static-analyzer
3. **Memory Safety** - Clear sensitive data from memory
4. **Constant Time** - Use constant-time operations for cryptographic comparisons
5. **Dependencies** - Keep cryptographic libraries updated

## Security Features

### Current Protections

- **Secure Random Generation** - Uses system entropy sources
- **Memory Management** - Clears sensitive data when possible
- **Established Cryptography** - Uses OpenSSL and secp256k1
- **No Network Communication** - Completely offline operation
- **Input Validation** - Validates user inputs and parameters

### Planned Security Enhancements

- [ ] Hardware security module (HSM) support
- [ ] Secure memory allocation for sensitive data
- [ ] Additional cryptographic algorithm support
- [ ] Enhanced input sanitization
- [ ] Formal security audit

## Known Security Considerations

### Limitations

1. **Simplified HD Derivation** - Current implementation uses simplified derivation logic
2. **Memory Security** - Standard memory allocation may leave traces in swap files
3. **Side-Channel Attacks** - Not hardened against timing or power analysis attacks
4. **Entropy Quality** - Relies on system entropy sources
5. **Platform Dependencies** - Security varies by operating system implementation

### Mitigations

- Use on secure, offline systems for production wallets
- Disable swap files when generating production keys
- Verify generated addresses using multiple tools
- Test thoroughly before using with real funds
- Keep the system updated with latest security patches

## Cryptographic Standards

### Algorithms Used

| Component | Algorithm | Standard |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Mnemonic to Seed | PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 | BIP39 |
| HD Key Derivation | HMAC-SHA512 | BIP32/BIP44 |
| Private Key Generation | secp256k1 | SEC 2 |
| Hash Functions | SHA-256, RIPEMD-160 | NIST, ISO |
| Address Generation | Various | Network-specific |

### Key Security Properties

- **Deterministic** - Same mnemonic always produces same keys
- **Non-reversible** - Cannot derive mnemonic from generated keys
- **Cryptographically Secure** - Uses established cryptographic primitives
- **Standard Compliant** - Follows BIP39/BIP44 specifications

## Audit Information

### Security Reviews

- **Internal Review**: Ongoing code review by maintainers
- **Community Review**: Open source code available for public audit
- **Automated Analysis**: Continuous integration with security scanning

### Planned Audits

- [ ] Professional security audit by third-party firm
- [ ] Formal cryptographic verification
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Fuzzing testing for input validation

## Security Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:
